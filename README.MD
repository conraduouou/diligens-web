# DILIGENS WEB

A website developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Quick Guidelines

This is to ensure that everyone is on the same page during our short journey in developing this website.

1. There are three main types of branches we will be using during this time--_main_, _develop_, and _specific_. The _specific_ type is where we will be mostly working on before merging it with develop, and then to main (production). 
2. The name of our specific branches, which will stem from the develop branch, should be develop-[**your name / alias**].[**develop version**]. Since we will be doing this in a terribly short amount of time, I doubt the develop version would change.
3. Commit should start with the present tense of the verb, not the past tense (e.g, "_fix_ login error" as opposed to "_fixed_ login error").
4. Do **not** merge on main until team specifies so.
5. Directories are made and named accordingly to our discussion regarding software architecture MVC.
6. When creating a screen, **DO** create a separate folder inside the _view_ folder to house its own HTML file and CSS if needed.
7. When creating a component, **DO** create a separate folder inside the _components_ folder _inside_ the _view_ folder to house its own HTML file and CSS if needed.
8. When creating a controller (a JavaScript file), it should follow the same architecture of its correlating view (e.g, src/views/home/home.html and src/controllers/home/home.js).
